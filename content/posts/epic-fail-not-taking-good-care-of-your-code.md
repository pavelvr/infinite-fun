## Epic Fail: Not Taking Good Care of Your Code
##### 2016.05.23 {.date}

Since I just created my personal website (finally!), I've been trying to locate some of my old projects, scripts, etc., in order to put them all in one place, create github repositories for each one of them and such.

The problem is I haven't took good care of all this code. Some was posted in forum's threads in the [Archlinux's BBS](https://bbs.archlinux.org/), some in [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net), and some have been only accumulating dust in my harddrives. That's what I call an _Epic Fail_!

For example, at least one of those projects have been published as a repository on github, by someone who was genuinely trying to help me and my project to survive in a better place than a forum thread. This project even found one more person who wrote a patch for it, made a pull request, contributed. Now, how could I rescue my project without looking as an ungrateful person?

Unfortunatelly, there are a lot more reasons and consequences of not being able or resposable enough with your own code. 

Well, let's see what I can do. At least I'm in the good path now.
