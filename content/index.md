## Infinite Fun _première_
##### 2016.05.22 {.date}

For years I wanted to create my personal blog/website, so I could share my thougts, ideas, code, questions with everyone out there with similar tastes and interests in technology. Sometimes I didn't find the time, others the means (I only have Internet at work, not at home), or didn't find anything worth of sharing (at least IMHO) in my stuff.

The real thing is I don't want to delay it anymore, so, here it is.

My hope is that by sharing I could learn a lot, raise the standards of quality for my writing, my code, and my English (I'm not a native English speaker) and at least some of my stuff helps other people.

Technology has been my passion for almost 20 years now, mainly computers and programming, and I see it as an infinite source of fun, hence the name **Infinite Fun**.

Programming allows us to approach problems in a different way, to think in a different way, to be a lot more creative, it opens a world of possibilities, liberates and &mdash;I can't stress this enough&mdash; is really, really fun.

Please, feel free to contact me at any time, even to correct my English. It will be much appreciated. Thanks in advance.
